If you're a newbie at HTML, this'll help you get started.

## What is HTML? Why should I program in it?
HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage and is used in areas of web development, specifically, page structuring.

As to why you **should** program in it is really up to you and your preferences, but, what I can tell you is:
if you're inspired to make a good looking, well structured site and don't know where to start, you should definitely look into learning this useful programming language as it provides a multitude of different things to help you make a stunning website. 

I mean this as a tip by saying that if you use a website creator, it won't work out how you planned. Trust me, I've tried before.
